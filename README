libmusical is supposed to provide classes and functions to align sequences of symbols.

To develop in Eclipse:

Suppose the SVN rep is in ${SVNROOT}/libmusical

1. Create an empty directory _outside_ the libmusical tree.
2. In that directory invoke: cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ${SVNROOT}/libmusical/trunk/
3. Open Eclipse and create a new project using the generated files.
