Release 1.0.1 - 25 september 2013
* Improvements in gnuplot code
* thisscore in initial gaps in AffineGlobalAligner now set.
* Added similarityrater for Midi and NLB symbols (NLBMidiIntervalSimilarityRater). Uses only pitch. 
* Now a custom pitch40Shift can be provided to a NLBSequences object
* All possible pitch shifts and corresponding histogram intersections are kept in the NLBSequences object.
* Added attributes onset, phrase and songpos to NLBSymbol
* made NLBJSONReader::generateSequence() more robust

Release 1.0.0 - 16 december 2011
* Moved the resulting alignment from the AlignmentAlgorithm to the Sequences object.
* Refactoring
  NeedlemanWunsch -> LinearGlobalAligner
  NeedlemanWunschGotoh -> AffineGlobalAligner
  SmithWaterman -> LinearLocalAligner
  SmithWatermanGotoh -> AffineLocalAligner
  Reason: the implementations differ (slightly) from the algorithms in the literature.
* Now LinearLocalAligner uses the LinearGapRater.
* Added a test
* Added constness
* Renamed Opti- to NLB-
* Small adjustment in MidiExactPitchIntervalSimilarityRater. First symbols now get score 1.0 to have self-similarity 1

Release 0.10.0 - 21 November 2011
* Now NeedlemanWunschGotoh uses the AffineGapRater.
* Added gnuplot output to AlignmentVisualizer
* Removed AlignmentAlgorithm::setGapRater()
  Removed AlignmentAlgorithm::setSimilarityRater()
  Raters now must be set through the constructor of the Algorithm class
  This is to ensure that the algorithm gets the right raters.
* Added class AffineGapRater. To be used with NeedlemanWunschGotoh / Affine local alignment.
