TODO
* Rename the algorithms
  NeedlemanWunsch -> GlobalLinearAligner
  NeedlemanWunschGotoh -> GlobalAffineAligner
  SmithWaterman -> LocalLinearAligner
  SmithWatermanGotoh -> LocalAffineAligner
  Reason: the implementations differ from the algorithms in the literature.
* Add MongeauSankoffAligner (other name?)
* Add GeneralGlobalAligner
* Add GeneralLocalAligner

Release 0.10.x - d.d. (in progress)
* Added gnuplot output to AlignmentVisualizer
* Removed AlignmentAlgorithm::setGapRater()
  Removed AlignmentAlgorithm::setSimilarityRater()
  Raters now must be set through the constructor of the Algorithm class
  This is to ensure that the algorithm gets the right raters.
* Added class AffineGapRater. To be used with NeedlemanWunschGotoh / Affine local alignment.
